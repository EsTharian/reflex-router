# Changelog

None of these versions has been published to a registry.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-09-19

- Fix: a setting exported as an empty string was treated as set. An empty `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` made `reflex doctor` (and every launch) fail with "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL must be an http(s) URL" instead of using the default upstream, and an empty `REFLEX_UPSTREAM_URL` hid a set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Every setting `loadConfig` reads now goes through one helper that treats an empty or whitespace-only value as unset, so the next source or the default applies. `~/.reflex/env` already treated empty process values as unset.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-19

- Fix: `reflex report` skips an unterminated last line of `decisions.jsonl` and counts it as skipped.
- `package.json` gains the `repository` field, so the README's relative `docs/` links resolve on a package page.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-19

- README rewrite; reference material moved to `docs/reference.md`.
- Test helper reads only complete lines of `decisions.jsonl` (CI race).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-19

- First tagged version.
